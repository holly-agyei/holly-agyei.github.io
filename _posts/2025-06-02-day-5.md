what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in-person kickstart day. We began by discussing the difference between AI research and traditional research—how AI problems are iterative and data-driven, while traditional research often follows a more fixed hypothesis-driven route. The practical examples helped a lot specifically, i got understanding of Neural networks and Backpropagation. 
  We also explored the CEAMLS mission and objectives. I got a clearer understanding of how AI models learn and adjust weights to minimize error.

  We played a team-building game where each group was challenged to build the tallest structure. It was fun—even though we didn’t win, I learned something about structure and design.  
  Later, we had lunch with Dr. Jamell and our grad mentors. We talked about our goals, interests, and the overall vibe was inspiring—Dr. Jamell is honestly the coolest.

  In our lab time, we organized our whiteboard, set personal and project goals, and explored the dataset we’ll be working with. We did some initial EDA and started playing with the data to better understand its shape and what it can tell us.

  At first, I couldn’t see anything when I tried to display the dataset—it was just blank. But I eventually figured it out and got things working again.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed today. It felt like everything started to come together—from research mindset to teamwork to hands-on data. Connecting with mentors and seeing everyone’s excitement made me even more motivated for what’s ahead.
