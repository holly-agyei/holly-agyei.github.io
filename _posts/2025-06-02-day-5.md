what_i_learned: |
  Today we were introduced to the world of generative AI, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs). We covered key concepts like tokenization and embeddings, and explored a wide range of generative AI tools—including Character.AI and others—to understand how these models generate text and images.
  We played a game (Kirat or something!) to test our understanding, which made learning even more interactive.
  In our project groups, we analyzed whether images were AI-generated or real and discussed ways to authenticate content using AI signatures and watermarks.
  We also went deeper into Python—learning advanced file systems, working with disk operations, and using sets effectively.

blockers: |
  It was a bit challenging to tell real images from AI-generated ones at first. Also, keeping track of how tokenization and embeddings work inside LLMs took some effort to fully understand.

reflection: |
  I really liked how today's activities connected both theory and practice. It’s one thing to learn about generative AI, but testing it, playing with tools, and discussing real vs. fake content made it feel real. The hands-on Python file system work also helped me feel more confident managing data at a deeper level.
