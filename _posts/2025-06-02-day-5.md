what_i_learned: |
  Today was centered on technical setup and application. We began with an introduction to **Computer Vision** — how computers interpret images, videos, and visual patterns using machine learning. We discussed how it's used in fields like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical imaging.
  
  We then transitioned to setting up our environment for **YOLOv8**, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model. Though it came with some setup challenges, we managed to get everything running and even experimented with basic detections.
  
  Afterward, we participated in a high-energy **team game** that simulated an escape-room challenge. It required fast thinking, communication, and collaboration to “unlock” our way out — a great reminder of how crucial soft skills are in technical spaces.
  
  We ended the day reviewing Python fundamentals, focusing on **file input/output**: how to read, write, and manipulate files — a skill we’ll need as we start working with datasets.

  Setting up the YOLOv8 environment was a bit tricky due to dependency issues and some compatibility errors, but with peer and mentor support, we got it sorted.

reflection: |
  I appreciated how today balanced both technical learning and team interaction. Learning to use computer vision tools felt like opening a new superpower. The escape game was also a highlight — it pushed me to think and collaborate quickly. Overall, I’m seeing how all these skills will tie into our larger project ahead.
