what_i_learned: |
  Today we kicked off our literature reviews. Our grad mentor shared a few research papers and walked us through them.
  One paper used deep learning on raw EHR data — no heavy preprocessing — just direct feature training.
  It showed strong performance, even predicting death risk accurately. We ended by connecting our summaries back to our own research.

blockers: |
  It took me a while to adjust to reading academic papers. Some of the concepts and terms were new, especially around how the models worked.
  I had to slow down and reread a few parts, but I’m getting more comfortable with the language and structure.

reflection: |
  A solid shift into real research. Reading academic work was tough but rewarding. It made the project feel more real and exciting.
