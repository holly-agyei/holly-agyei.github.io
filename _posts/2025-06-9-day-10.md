what_i_learned: |
  Today we officially started our literature reviews, and it was a great shift into deeper research work. 
  Our grad mentor introduced us to a few key papers and guided us through what to look for.

  At first, the number of pages looked overwhelming, but I managed to finish them. The paper we focused on explored 
  using deep learning models with Electronic Health Records (EHR). One key concept I learned was:
  
  a) Direct feature training — this approach skips heavy data preprocessing and instead feeds raw EHR data 
  into a deep learning model. The model then learns to make hypotheses and trains accordingly.

  This method turned out to be both efficient and accurate. One example in the paper showed how the model predicted 
  a high death risk that later turned out to be correct.

  At the end of the session, we all shared our summaries and discussed how the papers connect to our research goals 
  — and how we might apply or improve upon those methods in our own project.

  It took time to understand the papers and some of the technical terms, but I’m gradually catching on.

reflection: |
  Day 10 felt like a turning point — diving into real academic papers gave the research more weight. 
  It was challenging at first, but finishing the reading and engaging in discussion made me feel more capable. 
  I’m excited to build on this foundation in the coming days.
