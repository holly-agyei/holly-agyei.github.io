  Today, our team focused on narrowing down which comorbidity of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) to investigate for deeper analysis. We started by reviewing a curated dataset from our graduate mentor, which listed the 20 most common comorbidities associated with T1D. After comparing prevalence rates and potential impact, we collectively decided to concentrate on hypertension, a complex and widespread condition affecting many people with diabetes.

  To build a solid foundation, we conducted a deep dive into hypertension—distinguishing between primary (essential) and secondary forms. Through team-led discussions, interactive Q&A sessions, and quizzes, we challenged one another’s understanding and reinforced key medical and biological concepts. We also worked hands-on with our dataset to clean and structure it effectively for analysis.

  As part of this process, we collaboratively generated five focused research questions about hypertension, aiming to explore biological indicators, risk factors, and correlations specific to T1D. One particularly interesting insight was identifying the most commonly observed biological parameter among hypertensive individuals, which could serve as a marker in future screening or diagnostic models.

  Initially, it was difficult to fully grasp the clinical differences between primary and secondary hypertension, especially in how they manifest within the T1D population. The literature often overlaps in symptom descriptions and causative factors, which led to some confusion during group discussions. Additionally, while cleaning the dataset, we encountered inconsistencies in how certain biological parameters were recorded, requiring extra attention and consensus on how to standardize them.

  Despite these challenges, the team environment made problem-solving much more manageable. Talking through confusion points and comparing interpretations helped us align on terminology and research direction. We’ve also become more efficient at using our shared tools for data annotation and validation.

  Today reinforced how collaborative research deepens both understanding and engagement. It was inspiring to see how each team member brought unique insights, from medical context to data manipulation techniques. Working through the complexities of hypertension made me realize just how interconnected biology and data science can be, especially when addressing real-world health challenges like T1D comorbidities.

  I'm looking forward to continuing this research direction. With a clearer focus and refined dataset, I feel more confident in our ability to generate meaningful findings. These experiences are not only strengthening my technical and research skills but also helping me understand the collaborative nature of biomedical inquiry—something I hope to carry forward in both academic and applied settings.
