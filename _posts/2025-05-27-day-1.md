what_i_learned: |
   Today was my first deep dive into version control systems. I explored Git and GitHub, learning how they track changes, collaborate across versions, and manage contributions in software projects. I also looked into tools like Google Docs and how their collaborative model compares with Git-based systems. I now understand what causes merge conflicts—mainly simultaneous edits to the same lines or file—and learned some basic conflict resolution strategies. One exciting milestone: I created my personal research profile website! It’s now live and will serve as a space to track my journey throughout the CEAMLS SARAI program.
blockers: |
    I initially had trouble understanding the difference between local and remote repositories, which caused a bit of confusion when pushing changes. Also, Git conflict examples in tutorials sometimes felt too abstract without hands-on scenarios, but that’s something I plan to work through in upcoming days.

reflection: |
  It felt empowering to gain a foundational grasp of tools that almost every developer uses. Seeing how Git and GitHub enable structured collaboration made me appreciate the complexity behind teamwork in software. I’m looking forward to using these skills in future research and team-based tasks.
