what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team collaborated to determine which comorbidity of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) to focus on, using a cleaned dataset of the 20 most common comorbidities provided by our graduate mentor. After analyzing and discussing options, we chose to explore hypertension—both primary and secondary types. We dove deep into understanding hypertension through team-led Q&A sessions, discussions, and self-assessment quizzes. Additionally, we performed a round of collaborative data cleaning and developed five research-driven questions centered on hypertension. One key finding was identifying the most common biological parameter among individuals with hypertension in our dataset.

blockers: |
  It was initially challenging to differentiate between primary and secondary hypertension in the context of T1D. Some biological markers also had overlapping significance with other comorbidities, making interpretation slightly unclear. However, working through these challenges as a team helped clarify many of the concepts.

reflection: |
  Today’s session highlighted the importance of structured collaboration in research. Working together to explore a medically complex topic like hypertension gave me a deeper appreciation for how data and biology intersect. I’m excited to apply what we’ve uncovered to shape future questions and analyses in the CEAMLS SARAI program.
