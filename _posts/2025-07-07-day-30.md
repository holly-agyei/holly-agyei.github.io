what_i_learned: |
  We've completed our mid summer presentation, and it's been a valuable experience. 
  Today, we took the time to reflect on how far we've come and assess our progress. 
  We revisited our research questions and evaluated how well our project is aligned with them. 
  This reflection has given us a clearer understanding of what we need to focus on moving forward.

blockers: |
  Tailoring our project to answer all our research questions is proving to be a challenging task. 
  It requires careful consideration and adjustments to our approach. 
  However, we're committed to overcoming these challenges and producing high-quality research.

reflection: |
  It's been a tough but rewarding process, and I'm proud of what we've achieved so far. 
  I'm excited to see how our project will evolve as we refocus our efforts on answering our research questions. 
  I'm confident that with persistence and dedication, we'll be able to produce meaningful results. 
  The journey ahead won't be easy, but we're ready for the challenge.
