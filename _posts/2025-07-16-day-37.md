what_i_learned: |
  Today, I discussed the calculation of insulin dosage based on the Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF). 
  The formula used is insulin_dose = (current_glucose - target_glucose) / ISF. 
  We considered the implications of using a fixed target glucose versus an adaptive target. 
  It was decided that the target should sensibly not be fixed for better personalization.

blockers: |
  There are no major blockers at the moment regarding insulin dosage calculation. 
  However, we need to consider how to adjust the action space to handle wider dose ranges.

reflection: |
  I'm considering the best approach to implement insulin dosage calculation in our model. 
  Using the ISF to determine insulin dosage based on current glucose levels and a target seems like a viable approach. 
  I'm looking forward to adjusting our code to accommodate this calculation and testing its effectiveness. 
  The discussion on fixed versus adaptive targets was insightful.
