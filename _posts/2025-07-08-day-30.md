what_i_learned: |
  Today, we met with our faculty mentor to discuss the next steps in our research project. 
  We explored the idea of stacking one or two models with a transformer to create a unique model that leverages the strengths of each. 
  This approach has the potential to significantly improve our results and contribute to the field. 
  We're excited to dive deeper into this idea and see where it takes us.

blockers: |
  The technical aspects of model development and stacking can be complex and challenging. 
  We'll need to carefully consider the design and implementation of our model to ensure it meets our research goals. 
  However, with the guidance of our faculty mentor, we're confident that we can overcome any technical hurdles.

reflection: |
  Today was a very technical day, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to discuss our research with our faculty mentor. 
  Their expertise and feedback were invaluable, and I'm excited to apply what we've learned. 
  We're looking forward to writing our research paper and publishing our findings. 
  It's a significant milestone, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far.
