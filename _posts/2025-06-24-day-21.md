what_i_learned: |
  Today, we built on what we did yesterday and focused on model improvement. 
  After collaborating with our mentor, we started getting our model right. 
  The feedback and guidance from our mentor were instrumental in helping us refine our approach.

blockers: |
  Although we made progress today, there might be further refinements needed to perfect our model. 
  We'll continue to iterate and fine-tune our approach to ensure the best results. 
  I'm confident that our collaborative efforts will pay off.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm glad we were able to make progress on our model. 
  The collaboration with our mentor was invaluable, and I'm looking forward to continuing our work. 
  I'm excited to see how our model will perform after these improvements.
