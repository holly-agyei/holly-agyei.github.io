what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on adjusting the reward function in the T1DHypertensionEnvironment to better align with the agent's performance. 
  Tweaks were made to reduce medication costs, increase base bonuses for being in range, and adjust out-of-range penalties. 
  Additionally, we addressed the presentation of metrics (TIR, TBR, TAR) and their standard deviations to avoid implying an additive range that could exceed 100%. 
  The output format for metrics was changed to use "SD:" instead of "±" for clarity.

blockers: |
  There were discussions about how to present metrics and their standard deviations accurately. 
  The need to adjust the reward function to better reflect the agent's good performance was identified. 
  No major blockers remain at this point.

reflection: |
  I'm pleased with the adjustments made to the reward function and the metrics presentation. 
  These changes should help in better evaluating the agent's performance and aligning rewards with desired outcomes. 
  Considering the professor's feedback on metrics presentation was valuable. 
  I'll continue to monitor the agent's performance and make further adjustments as needed.
