what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive day, and we made significant progress on our research. 
  We discussed further and decided to develop four models, with the ultimate goal of creating a hybrid model that combines the strengths of each. 
  This approach will make our research unique and contribute to the field in a meaningful way.

  I worked on the regular model, and we reviewed it together, discussing ways to refine it. 
  It was helpful to get feedback and insights from the team, and I'm excited to implement the suggested improvements. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing how the different models come together to form a robust hybrid model.

blockers: |
  There weren't any major blockers today, but I'm aware that integrating the four models into a hybrid one might be challenging. 
  We'll need to carefully consider how to combine the models effectively and ensure that the hybrid model performs well. 
  I'm confident that with our team's expertise and collaboration, we can overcome any obstacles.

reflection: |
  Today was really cool, and I enjoyed discussing our research plans and potential conference opportunities. 
  We talked about conferences where we could publish our research, which got me thinking about the broader impact of our work. 
  We also shared tasks and responsibilities, which will help us stay organized and focused as we move forward. 
  I'm excited about the progress we're making and the potential of our research.
