what_i_learned: |
  Today built on yesterday's momentum, but with a big focus on connection. I learned the value of clear communication—not just in code, but in understanding how others think. We played interactive games that revealed how people guess, collaborate, and interpret things differently. It was fun, but also revealing. I also continued working on my research profile website. Every line I add makes the site feel more like my digital home.  
  We also discussed our individual research goals and mapped out our road ahead. I joined my assigned team group, and after our conversations, I already love my mentor's approach and energy. I’ll be working on a project involving Deep Q-Networks to help manage diabetes-related comorbidities.

  While customizing the website, I got a bit stuck styling certain sections to make them responsive across different screen sizes. Also, trying to balance creativity with clarity was challenging—but I’m learning to iterate patiently.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed today. The games showed how important emotional intelligence is in tech spaces. You don’t just build solutions—you build with people. And continuing to develop my website reminded me how fulfilling it is to shape my own story in code. Talking through my research direction helped everything feel more real and exciting.
