what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team reviewed a cleaned dataset of the 20 most common T1D comorbidities provided by our graduate mentor. After discussion, we selected hypertension—both primary and secondary—as our focus. We explored its causes, types, and relevance to T1D through Q&A, team quizzes, and discussions. We also cleaned related data and developed five guiding research questions. One key insight was identifying a top biological parameter commonly found in people with hypertension.

blockers: |
  We initially struggled to distinguish between primary and secondary hypertension and how they relate to T1D. Some medical terms and parameter overlaps added to the confusion. Standardizing inconsistent data entries also slowed us down, but group discussion helped clarify key points.

reflection: |
  It was rewarding to learn collaboratively while digging into a complex health topic. Understanding hypertension in the context of T1D gave me a better sense of how medical research and data science intersect. I’m excited to keep building on this work in the coming days.
