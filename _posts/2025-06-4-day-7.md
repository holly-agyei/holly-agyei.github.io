what_i_learned: |
   Today, our team analyzed a cleaned dataset of the 20 most common T1D comorbidities shared by our graduate mentor. We chose to focus on hypertension, exploring both primary and secondary types through readings, group discussions, and team quizzes. We also refined the dataset and drafted five key research questions. One major insight was identifying a frequently recurring biological parameter among hypertensive individuals.
blockers: |
  It was initially hard to separate primary from secondary hypertension, especially within the context of diabetes. Some data entries had inconsistent formats, and interpreting overlapping parameters was confusing at first. Team discussions and clarification from mentors helped resolve most of these issues.

reflection: |
   Working with the team to explore hypertension gave me a clearer view of how data informs medical research. It felt meaningful to contribute to shaping our research direction while learning about a real-world health challenge. I’m eager to keep building momentum as we dive deeper.
