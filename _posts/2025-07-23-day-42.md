what_i_learned: |
  Today, I analyzed the agent's performance variability across different episodes. 
  The standard deviations of TIR, TBR, and TAR for glucose and BP are being considered. 
  I'm looking into ways to reduce variability and improve consistency in the agent's performance. 
  The agent is generally performing well in terms of TIR for glucose.

blockers: |
  Interpreting variability in performance metrics can be challenging. 
  Reducing variability without sacrificing performance is a potential hurdle. 
  Ensuring the agent's performance is robust across different scenarios is a consideration.

reflection: |
  Analyzing variability is important for ensuring the agent's reliability. 
  I'll look into methods to minimize variability while maintaining good performance. 
  The agent's current performance is promising. 
  Next steps include further refinement and testing.
