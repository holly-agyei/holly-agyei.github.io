what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on optimizing the DDQN training loop for speed and performance. 
  I implemented several changes, including reusing environment instances, sampling a subset of patients per episode, and throttling model updates. 
  These adjustments should significantly reduce runtime without sacrificing learning quality. 
  I'm excited to see how these changes impact the training process and the agent's performance.

blockers: |
  There were some indentation errors in the code that needed to be fixed. 
  However, these issues have been resolved, and the code should now run without syntax errors.

reflection: |
  I'm pleased with the progress I've made on optimizing the DDQN training loop. 
  The changes I've implemented should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the training process. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing the results and making further adjustments as needed. 
  The agent's performance is still not perfectly stable, but it's showing signs of improvement.
