what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued training the agent in the T1DHypertensionEnvironment. 
  The adjustments made to the reward function are showing promising results. 
  I'm monitoring the agent's performance in terms of TIR, TBR, and TAR for glucose and BP. 
  The agent is learning to balance control of glucose levels and blood pressure.

blockers: |
  One potential blocker is ensuring the agent generalizes well to different patient profiles. 
  Computational resources could become a limitation if training episodes are increased significantly. 
  Balancing exploration and exploitation in the agent's learning is an ongoing challenge.

reflection: |
  I'm pleased with how the training is progressing. 
  The changes to the reward function seem to be effective. 
  I'll continue to monitor the agent's performance and make adjustments as needed. 
  Evaluating the agent's ability to generalize to different patient profiles is a next step.
