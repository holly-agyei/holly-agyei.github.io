what_i_learned: |
  Today was an exciting day - I finally built my Deep Q-Network (DQN) model!!! 
  The regular DQN model learns from data and chooses the best action for each state, which is a significant milestone in our project. 
  Next, I'm planning to build a noisy DQN model and compare their performance to see how the noise affects the model's decision-making.

  It was a lot of learning, and our faculty mentor gave us a challenging task to get some code running within 2 hours. 
  Initially, I was confused about where to start, but as time went on, I learned, researched, prepared the data, and got it running. 
  It was a great experience, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far.

blockers: |
  At first, I struggled to understand the requirements and implement the DQN model. 
  However, with the faculty mentor's guidance and my own research, I was able to overcome the challenges and get the model running. 
  One thing I'm looking forward to is comparing the performance of the regular and noisy DQN models.

reflection: |
  Today was a huge accomplishment for me, and I'm thrilled to see our project taking shape. 
  Building the DQN model was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to continue working on it. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing how the different models perform and what insights we can gain from the comparisons.
