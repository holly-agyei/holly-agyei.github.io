what_i_learned: |
  Today was a fun day, filled with the SAIRI enrichment block where we played a couple of fun games that taught us a lot about communication and social connection. 
  I learnt that effective communication is key to building strong relationships and achieving our goals. 
  The games were engaging and interactive, making it easy to grasp these important concepts.

blockers: |
  Maybe one blocker for me was having a hard time socializing with some of my peers. 
  I felt a bit shy and introverted, but the games helped break the ice and made it easier to connect with others. 
  Despite this, I'm glad I pushed myself to participate and engage with the group.

reflection: |
  After the enrichment block, we came back to the labs and continued with code analyses of the RL framework for sugar simulation. 
  We made good progress and discussed what we will do tomorrow, which includes defining our research questions. 
  I'm looking forward to tomorrow's session and refining our research focus. 
  Today was a great balance of fun and productivity, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow with my peers.
