what_i_learned: |
  Today, our plans changed due to the postponement of the mid symposium. 
  Instead of preparing for the symposium, we focused on working more on our models. 
  It's paying off, as our models' accuracy is increasing - a testament to the power of hard work.

blockers: |
  However, when I tried to change some parameters in my model, its accuracy fell back a bit. 
  I'm not discouraged, though - it's all part of the learning process. 
  Our grad mentor's feedback has been invaluable, and I'm looking forward to trying out new approaches.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm excited about the progress we're making. 
  Our grad mentor suggested that I switch to a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) instead, so I'll be giving that a try. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing how it performs and what insights I can gain from the experience.
