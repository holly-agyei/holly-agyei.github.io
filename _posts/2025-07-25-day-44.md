what_i_learned: |
  Today, I evaluated the outcomes of the agent's actions in the T1DHypertensionEnvironment. 
  The agent is achieving good control of glucose levels and BP. 
  Outcomes in terms of TIR, TBR, TAR for glucose and BP are satisfactory. 
  Considering next steps for the project, like further testing or deployment considerations.

blockers: |
  Deciding on the next steps for the project based on current outcomes can be challenging. 
  Ensuring the agent's outcomes are clinically relevant and useful is a consideration. 
  Potential limitations in translating the agent's performance to real-world scenarios need to be addressed.

reflection: |
  The agent's outcomes are promising. 
  Evaluating these outcomes helps in understanding the agent's effectiveness. 
  Planning next steps is crucial for moving forward. 
  I'll consider further refinements or expansions of the project.
