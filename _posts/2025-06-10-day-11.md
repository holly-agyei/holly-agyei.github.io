what_i_learned: |
  Getting ready for the coding topic. For the past weeks, we have been diving into the biological aspects of the program but today marked the start of our preparation into the deep-q networks and RL.
  We reviewed research papers, made conclusions, and figured out how we could inculcate those into our research. The papers provided valuable insights into the applications of deep-q networks in various fields.
  We also gained a better understanding of how RL can be used to improve the efficiency of our project. Our grad mentor's guidance was instrumental in helping us grasp these complex concepts.

blockers: |
  Today was pretty cool, no major blockers I will say. However, the sessions could have been more engaging if they were spread out over a longer period. 
  Maybe it got boring in the afternoon when we had finished most of our stuff, but overall, it worked out.

reflection: |
  Today was a significant step in our research journey, marking a shift from biological aspects to coding and deep-q networks. 
  I appreciated the opportunity to meet with our faculty mentor, Dr. Jamel Dacon, and learn from his expertise. 
  His workshop-style meeting helped us refine our research aims and identify potential pitfalls.
