what_i_learned: |
  Today, we finalized our presentation slides and content, ensuring that everything is polished and ready for the big day. 
  We rehearsed our presentation several times, fine-tuning our delivery and timing. 
  Our confidence is growing as we feel well-prepared for the final presentation.

blockers: |
  One potential blocker is nerves on the day of the presentation, which could impact our performance. 
  We need to ensure that our technology and equipment are working properly to avoid any last-minute issues. 
  Staying focused and composed under pressure will be key.

reflection: |
  It's great to see our hard work coming together in a cohesive and compelling presentation. 
  Rehearsing has helped us feel more confident and prepared. 
  I'm looking forward to delivering a strong presentation and receiving feedback from our audience.
