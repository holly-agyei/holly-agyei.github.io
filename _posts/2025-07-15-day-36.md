what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on personalizing the model using the Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) for each patient. 
  ISF levels are estimated using age, sex, and creatinine levels, which influence insulin sensitivity. 
  Patients are grouped into three sensitivity categories based on these factors. 
  The DDQN model now generates insulin recommendations adjusted for individual ISF.

blockers: |
  The model's performance is showing signs of convergence, but I'm currently adjusting the reward function to improve stability and learning efficiency. 
  There are no major blockers at the moment.

reflection: |
  I'm pleased with the progress made in personalizing the model using ISF. 
  Tailoring insulin dosage recommendations to each patient's ISF should improve the model's effectiveness. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing how the adjustments to the reward function impact the model's performance. 
  The input state vector includes ISF, five biochemical markers, sex, and age, which should help in making informed decisions.
