what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started working on our research design document, which was a crucial step in shaping our project. 
  We asked research questions and began answering them, which helped clarify our objectives and focus. 
  This process also enabled us to identify potential gaps in our knowledge and understanding.

blockers: |
  One challenge I faced was articulating my thoughts clearly in the research design document. 
  I had to revisit some of the concepts we covered earlier to ensure I was on the right track. 
  Additionally, narrowing down our research questions to something manageable was a bit tricky, but our discussions helped refine our approach.

reflection: |
  After working on the research design, we discussed our plans for next week and reviewed a whole lot of papers. 
  The papers provided valuable insights into the latest developments in our field and helped us contextualize our research. 
  I'm excited to build on what we've accomplished so far and tackle the challenges ahead.
