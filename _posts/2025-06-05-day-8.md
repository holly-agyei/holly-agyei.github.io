what_i_learned: |
  Today was one of the most enjoyable days of the program so far. We had our cohort enrichment block, where we toured several buildings across the MSU campus and explored different research spaces and initiatives. I was surprised by how large the campus is—it’s the biggest I’ve seen so far. My favorite stop was the engineering building, where I got to speak with researchers and learn about some of the exciting projects happening in one of the labs.

  Back in our lab session, we picked up from Day 7 and continued cleaning our hypertension dataset. I spent most of my time working on exploratory data analysis, especially building a bar chart to show correlations between the mean values of the top five biochemical parameters across different age groups. We wrapped up with a group discussion and outlined our next steps with our graduate mentor for the upcoming week.

  I struggled with generating a grouped bar chart that clearly displayed multiple variables by age group. At first, my plots were either cluttered or missing key labels. I had to spend time researching plotting libraries, checking documentation, and testing different formats. It took longer than expected, but I eventually figured it out—and I learned a lot through the process.

reflection: |
     I’m starting to realize how much I’m learning—not just from lectures or labs, but through doing, struggling, and solving real problems. Today reminded me that research is more than just data and analysis; it’s about curiosity, exploration, and persistence. Seeing the MSU research environment and getting a taste of its breadth really motivated me to stay engaged and keep growing.
