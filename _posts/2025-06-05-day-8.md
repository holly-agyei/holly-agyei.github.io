what_i_learned: |
    Today was one of the most enjoyable days of the program so far. We had our cohort enrichment block, where we toured several buildings across the MSU campus and explored different research spaces and initiatives. I was surprised by how large the campus is—it’s the biggest I’ve seen so far. My favorite stop was the engineering building, where I got to speak with researchers and learn about some of the exciting projects happening in one of the labs.

    Back in our lab session, we picked up from Day 7 and continued cleaning our hypertension dataset. I spent most of my time working on exploratory data analysis, especially building a bar chart to show correlations between the mean values of the top five biochemical parameters across different age groups. We wrapped up with a group discussion and outlined our next steps with our graduate mentor for the upcoming week.

  It was tough figuring out how to generate a grouped bar chart. I had to look up examples and troubleshoot along the way—it took time, but I got it working in the end.

reflection: |
  I’m starting to realize how much I’m learning, both in research techniques and problem-solving. Today showed me that research can be both challenging and fun.
