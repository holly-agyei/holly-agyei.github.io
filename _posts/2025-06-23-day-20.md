what_i_learned: |
  Today was a valuable lesson in the importance of proper Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
  We attempted to check the accuracy of our Deep Q-Network (DQN) model, but it wasn't performing well, with an accuracy of around 25%. 
  Upon closer inspection, we discovered that our data had null values and other issues that we hadn't accounted for.

  This experience highlighted the need for thorough EDA to ensure that our data is clean and reliable. 
  It's clear that data quality has a significant impact on model performance, and we're taking steps to address these issues. 
  I'm learning to appreciate the importance of investing time in EDA to avoid downstream problems.

blockers: |
  The low accuracy of our DQN model was a challenge, but it led us to investigate the data quality issues. 
  We're now working to address these problems and improve our model's performance. 
  Another challenge is rethinking our evaluation metrics - we're questioning whether accuracy is the best metric for our use case.

reflection: |
  Today was a great learning experience, and I'm realising the importance of proper EDA in machine learning projects. 
  We're exploring alternative metrics, such as using rewards over time rather than accuracy, which could provide a more nuanced understanding of our model's performance. 
  I'm excited to see how these changes will impact our project and what insights we'll gain from our data.
