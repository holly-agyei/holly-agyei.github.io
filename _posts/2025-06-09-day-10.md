what_i_learned: |
  We started our literature reviews today. Our grad mentor introduced a few key papers and helped us break them down.  
  One paper focused on using deep learning directly on raw EHR data — skipping preprocessing and letting the model learn patterns on its own.  
  It was interesting to see how this method predicted patient outcomes, including death risk, with strong accuracy.  

  After reading, we each shared a quick summary and discussed how the research could apply to our own work or be improved.

blockers: |
  Some of the technical terms and deep learning concepts took a while to understand.  
  I had to reread a few parts and do some quick searching to follow along, but I’m starting to get the hang of it.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a real step into academic research. The reading was dense but rewarding, and connecting it to our own project made it feel more meaningful.
