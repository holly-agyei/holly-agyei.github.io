what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the first day of the coding part of our project, and we made significant progress. 
  We completed our design document and collaborated with a faculty mentor to review and refine it. 
  The mentor's feedback was invaluable in helping us critique and improve our design, making it more specific and focused.

  We also delved into the RL framework, exploring how we can strategize to fit its needs, including defining the environment, agent, and other key components. 
  Understanding the framework's requirements will be crucial in developing an effective model. 
  I'm excited to dive deeper into the coding aspect and see our project come to life.

blockers: |
  One challenge I'm anticipating is choosing the best parameters for our model. 
  With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to determine the optimal settings. 
  I'm planning to experiment with different parameters and leverage existing research to inform our decisions.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm glad we had the opportunity to work on our design document and explore the RL framework. 
  The collaboration with our faculty mentor was particularly helpful in refining our approach. 
  I'm looking forward to continuing our coding journey and overcoming the challenges that come with it.
