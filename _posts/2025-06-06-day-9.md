  Today marked the end of our first week, and we spent time organizing everything we’ve done so far. We looked back at our progress—our EDA work, team activities, and project planning—and brought it all together.

  We also had a chance to reflect on what worked well, what didn’t, and what we want to improve. It was great to see how far we've come in just a few days.

  Afterward, we finalized the Frozen Lake game challenge. It was fun to test our logic and code under constraints and see how different teams approached the same problem.

  Finally, we wrapped up with our weekly presentations. Each group shared what they accomplished, what challenged them, and how they tackled it. It felt like a supportive space to learn from each other.

  The presentation didn’t go smoothly at first—I had to try three times to get it working properly. But I kept going, and it finally worked. Felt good to not give up.

reflection: |
  Wrapping up the week with a full-circle moment was satisfying. From code to collaboration, I saw the value of planning and persistence. I’m proud of what we built and excited for what’s coming next.
