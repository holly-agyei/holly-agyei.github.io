  Today marked the end of our first week, and we spent time organizing everything we’ve done so far. We looked back at our progress—our EDA work, team activities, and project planning—and brought it all together.

  We also had a chance to reflect on what worked well, what didn’t, and what we want to improve. It was great to see how far we've come in just a few days.

  Afterward, we finalized the Frozen Lake game challenge. It was fun to test our logic and code under constraints and see how different teams approached the same problem.

  Finally, we wrapped up with our weekly presentations. Each group shared what they accomplished, what challenged them, and how they tackled it. It felt like a supportive space to learn from each other.

  The presentation didn’t work the first couple of times, which was a bit stressful. I had to try three times before it finally worked. I was relieved when it ran smoothly.  
  I realized I hadn’t practiced enough and rushed through the setup. It was a reminder to slow down and double-check everything. In the end, it was a small hiccup, but I learned from it.
reflection: |
  Today felt like a good wrap-up to the week. We brought all our work together and shared what we had done. It was nice hearing from others too.  
  I feel like I’m getting more comfortable with the process. It’s still early, but I’m slowly finding my rhythm. I’m looking forward to seeing how much we can build next week.
