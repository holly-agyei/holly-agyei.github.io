what_i_learned: |
  Today was similar to yesterday, with continued work on refining our models and approach. 
  However, the main focus of the day was researching and preparing for our presentation at the mid symposium. 
  We've been working hard to ensure that our slides are informative, clear, and engaging. 
  I'm confident that our preparation will pay off and we'll be able to effectively communicate our research.

blockers: |
  There aren't any major blockers at the moment, but we're aware that presenting our research can be a challenging task. 
  We'll need to stay calm and focused during the presentation to effectively convey our message.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made on our presentation. 
  I'm excited to share our research with others and receive feedback that will help us improve. 
  I'm looking forward to the mid symposium and the opportunity to showcase our work. 
  It's a great chance to reflect on what we've accomplished so far and plan for the next steps in our project.
