what_i_learned: |
  Today was another productive day of coding and working on our project. 
  However, the highlight of the day was our discussion with our faculty mentor. 
  We received valuable feedback and guidance on our research, and one key takeaway was the need to revisit our research questions. 
  This will help us refocus our efforts and ensure that we're on the right track. 
  I'm looking forward to refining our approach and exploring new avenues.

blockers: |
  There aren't any major blockers at the moment, but we're aware that revisiting our research questions may require some adjustments to our approach. 
  We'll need to be flexible and adapt to any changes that arise from this process. 
  However, I'm confident that this will ultimately strengthen our research.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to discuss our research with our faculty mentor. 
  Their insights and feedback were incredibly helpful, and I'm excited to apply what we've learned. 
  Revisiting our research questions will be a valuable exercise, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it shapes our project. 
  It's a good reminder to stay focused and ensure that our efforts are aligned with our goals.
