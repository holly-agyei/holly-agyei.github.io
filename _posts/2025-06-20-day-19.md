what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on finding the model accuracy and made some queries to get the results I needed. 
  Understanding the accuracy of our models is crucial in determining their performance and identifying areas for improvement. 
  I'm glad I was able to figure out the queries and get the insights I needed.

  We also discussed our plans for next week, and I'm excited to start working on combining all the models to build a hybrid model. 
  This will be a significant step in our research, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the different models come together. 
  The hybrid model has the potential to leverage the strengths of each individual model and produce more accurate results.

blockers: |
  Finding the model accuracy was a challenge, but I was able to figure it out after some trial and error. 
  It took some persistence and problem-solving, but I'm glad I was able to overcome the obstacle. 
  I'm aware that building the hybrid model might come with its own set of challenges, but I'm confident that we can work through them as a team.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm happy with the progress we made. 
  Discussing our plans for next week helped clarify our goals and objectives, and I'm excited to start working on the hybrid model. 
  I'm looking forward to seeing how our research unfolds and what insights we can gain from the hybrid model.
