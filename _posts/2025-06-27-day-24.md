what_i_learned: |
  Today, we built upon our existing model and included the top 5 biochemical parameters, which will enhance its performance and accuracy. 
  This addition will allow our model to capture more nuanced relationships and patterns in the data. 
  We're excited to see how this enhancement will impact our results and inform our future decisions. 
  Incorporating these parameters is a significant step forward in our research. 
  We're confident that this will bring us closer to our goals.

blockers: |
  There aren't any major blockers at the moment, but we're aware that integrating new parameters can sometimes introduce new challenges. 
  We'll need to monitor the model's performance closely to ensure that the addition of these parameters doesn't introduce any unforeseen issues. 
  However, we're well-equipped to handle any challenges that may arise.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I'm proud of the progress we've made. 
  We also created our weekly progress video, which will help us reflect on our journey and share our experiences with others. 
  It was great to include our high school teacher in the video, and their insights and feedback were invaluable. 
  I'm excited to share our video with a wider audience and showcase our work. 
  Overall, it's been a great day, and I'm looking forward to what's next.
