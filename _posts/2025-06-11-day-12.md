what_i_learned: |
  We kickstarted our coding today and reviewed Q-learning code with our faculty mentor, which provided valuable insights into implementing reinforcement learning for our project. The mentor's guidance helped clarify the code's logic and potential applications. I'm excited to apply these learnings to our research on Type 1 Diabetes and comorbidities.

  Additionally, we discussed the possibility of incorporating an additional dataset to enhance our research and explore more complex relationships between T1D and hypertension. This dataset could provide new perspectives on managing comorbidities and improve our model's accuracy. Our team is looking forward to integrating this new data into our project.

  Looking over oral code related to T1D and hypertension was also insightful, as it highlighted potential approaches to modeling these conditions. The code's structure and methodology will likely influence our project's direction. We're optimistic about the potential outcomes of our research.

blockers: |
  One potential challenge we discussed was ensuring the compatibility of the additional dataset with our existing framework. We'll need to carefully evaluate the dataset's structure and format to avoid integration issues. Our team is prepared to tackle this challenge and find a suitable solution.

  Another possible blocker is optimizing the Q-learning model's performance for our specific use case. We'll need to fine-tune the model's parameters and explore different approaches to achieve the best results. Our faculty mentor's guidance will be invaluable in overcoming this challenge.

  Lastly, managing the complexity of the project and ensuring all team members are on the same page might be a challenge. We'll need to maintain open communication and regularly review our progress to stay aligned and focused.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, getting our coding journey underway and gaining clarity on our project's direction. The discussions with our faculty mentor were particularly helpful in setting the stage for what's to come. I'm looking forward to building on this momentum and exploring the potential of our research.

  The team's energy and motivation are palpable, and I'm excited to see our project take shape. We're all committed to producing high-quality research that contributes meaningfully to the field. With our combined efforts and the mentor's guidance, I'm confident we'll achieve our goals.

  As we move forward, I'm eager to see how our project evolves and how we can apply our learnings to real-world problems. The experience gained from this project will undoubtedly be valuable for our future endeavors. I'm grateful for this opportunity and the support of our faculty mentor.
