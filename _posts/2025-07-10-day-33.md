what_i_learned: |
  Today, we attended a workshop on research paper writing, and it was incredibly insightful. 
  I learned about the importance of crafting a clear problem statement, creating effective outlines, and understanding the publication process. 
  These skills are essential for producing high-quality research papers, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn from experienced researchers. 
  The workshop was a valuable investment in our research journey.

blockers: |
  I realized that I need to work on articulating the problem statement for our project more clearly. 
  This workshop has given me the tools and motivation to improve in this area.

reflection: |
  I'm a bit embarrassed to admit that I've been working on a project without a well-defined problem statement. 
  But I'm glad I attended this workshop, and I'm excited to apply what I've learned. 
  I'm looking forward to refining our problem statement and producing a high-quality research paper. 
  This workshop has been a game-changer for me, and I'm grateful for the experience.
