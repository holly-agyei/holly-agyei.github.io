what_i_learned: |
  We were introduced to generative AI, deep learning, and LLMs. We explored key concepts like tokenization and embeddings, and tested different generative tools like Character.AI. We also played a game to check our understanding. Later in groups, we analyzed images to tell if they were AI-generated or not and discussed AI signatures and watermarks. We also practiced Python file handling and sets.

blockers: |
  It was tricky to spot real vs. AI-generated images. Understanding how tokenization works inside LLMs also took time.

reflection: |
  I liked how today mixed fun with deep learning. The image activity made me think more about AI’s impact, and the Python practice helped me grow more confident.
