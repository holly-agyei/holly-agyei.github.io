what_i_learned: |
  We continued exploring the dataset and focused on relationships between columns in each DataFrame using pandas. It was helpful seeing how these patterns can guide decisions.  
  My team and I dug deeper into T1D and started narrowing down which comorbidity we want to focus on. We found out that Type 1 Diabetes significantly affects the nerves and blood vessels. We're still finalizing our exact research path.  

  I also learned more about pandas basics and how to visualize data directly with pandas tools. It’s getting more intuitive.  
  Toward the end, we chatted with our grad mentors and had a fun, relaxed moment to wrap things up.

blockers: |
  I struggled a bit with setting the correct file path in Google Colab, but I eventually figured it out.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a steady continuation of the journey. It was focused, exploratory, and collaborative. Diving into real medical impact areas like T1D made the work feel meaningful, and the team energy kept it all motivating.
