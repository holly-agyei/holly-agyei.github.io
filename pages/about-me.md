  bio: |
    I'm a Computer Science Sophomore at Grambling State University with focus on data, machine learning and software systems.

    I am currently on the research team with Doctor Jamel exploring deep–Q networks in managing type1 diabetes comorbidities

    When I’m not working on looking into data or building something cool, I enjoy showing my progress, playing piano, and tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects in my free time.
